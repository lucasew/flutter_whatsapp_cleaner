For those who don't know, WhatsApp needs to backup the conversations because it doesn't work based on cloud, like Telegram or Messenger, but instead of just keeping the last one. It keeps the last one and up to 7 backups prior to it. Why? I don't know. When I run out of space the first thing I do is delete these old backups and that's what this application is for.

The big letters were a feedback received by potential users who no longer have such a good view.
